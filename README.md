# Transfer Learning in CNNs: Frozen vs Fine-Tuning (MobileNetV2)

Author: Sreeja Nalla  
Student ID: 24088662  

## Project Overview
This project compares three approaches to image classification using a flower dataset:

1. Baseline CNN trained from scratch
2. Transfer learning with a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone
3. Transfer learning with fine-tuning of the upper layers

The goal is to demonstrate the impact of transfer learning and fine-tuning on classification performance.
